    <h2> Latest Match Recap</h2>
    <p class="writeup">Having won two of the three previous Gold League Seasons, eStar was one of the favorites to win the Gold League Grand Finals. The Chinese powerhouse did not disappoint as eStar cruised through the group stage with a 6-1 record, dropping only one close match to TNL.

Zero Gaming was their first opponent in the playoffs. After a relatively close first game on Garden of Terror, eStar turned up their intensity and dominated the next two games to close out the series before meeting their longtime rival EDG in the finals. The two teams’ familiarity with each other ensured that, while the drafts would contain no surprises, the games would be a display of mechanical and tactical brilliance. The first four games saw momentum swing back and forth. eStar took the first game on a risky boss capture. EDG responded with a close Game 2 victory on Garden of Terror. Game 3 saw eStar make some aggressive shotcalling mistakes early on but still win the game through a decisive late game fight. Game Four was another nail biter with EDG winning the game due to poor positioning of eStar on the last tribute fight on Cursed Hollow. With the series tied 2-2, eStar were able to regain their focus and close out the next two games. Game 5 on Dragonshire was another close match with eStar showing off their team fighting superiority when it mattered and wiping EDG 22 minutes into the game through a key Falstad Gust from Tumi. Game 6 was more of the same as NccCc took full advantage of Diablo's Soulstone Trait and helped by utilizing a full retreat and re-engage for a team fight victory that sealed the game.

With the GHL Championship rings at hand, eStar can lay claim as the best Chinese team once again. We had the fortunate opportunity to speak with eStar Gaming's captain Xia0t and asked him a few questions.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Can you give us a brief introduction to the team?</span></p>
    <p>Hi everyone, we are eStar Gaming.
I am Xia0t, team captain. I was a professional Warcraft III player prior to forming this team.

NccCc is our Warrior player. He has never played professional video games before but is very talented. We found him because he was the highest ranked player on the Battle.Net ladder at that particular time. He thrives under pressure and was the MVP of Gold League Season 2.

XingC and Tumi are good friends that grew up together. XingC likes to dive into new things while Tumi is a bit more reserved and calculating. They complement each other perfectly and are able to cover for each other’s weaknesses.

Tiger is a talented young player. He is known as the most aggressive Support player in the Chinese scene. He can be somewhat of a showboat in game but he is really a kind hearted guy.</p>

    <p class="interview"><span class="bold">Congratulations on the being the GHL champion! You guys have been one of strongest teams in China for a while now, how have you been able to maintain your success?</span></p>
    <p>The key to success is to have five motivated players who want to continue to be the best they can be. This means maintaining a very grueling practice schedule and making sacrifices outside of the game. This means always trying to find weaknesses in our game. We go into each series very confident because we have rehearsed and practiced for every possible scenario and outcome.</p>
